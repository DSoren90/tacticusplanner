Minor improvements:
    - (Corusame) Would it be possible to add a tool which let's you bring up a list of every character that uses a specific upgrade that you enter? 
        going further but might be difficult would it be possible for it to show what gear ranks that upgrade is applied to https://discord.com/channels/1146809197023997972/1146809197023997975/1178590954089881620
    - update F.A.Q. and instructions page
    - (xenoblight+) Add "Equipment" table
    - (Fonzoland) If you want to score bonus points with the ordering, you could try to replicate the faction order in game. 
        It sorts by char count first, then by release order. It is fairly easy to determine, not sure how easy to display/change dynamically as units are added or removed.
    - (Argon) Multiple teams in LE planner  https://discord.com/channels/1146809197023997972/1146809197023997975/1178673694869049445
